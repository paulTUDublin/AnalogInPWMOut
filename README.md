# AnalogInPWMOut

- [X] Copy or clone this [repository](https://github.com/paulTUDublin/AnalogInPWMOut) and open as a platformIO project.
- [ ] Verify the board is working as you alter the voltage at the input pin using the potentiometer on the board. DOes the onboard LED (PB3 illuminate at the correct input voltage?)
- [ ] Use the scilloscope to view the voltage at the PWM output pin.
- [ ] Document any progress/changes in the README.md file (use [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) to format this document.) and upload your project to your GitHub repo.
